Human: hi, how are you feeling today?
Daniel: I'm feeling a bit down today. I'm having trouble concentrating on my work and my family is really stressing me out.
Human: tell me about your family
Daniel: My family is really important to me, but they can be really stressful. I have a lot of siblings and they're always fighting with each other. My parents are always working and they don't have a lot of time for me.
Human: do you get along well with your siblings?

RESPONSE:

No, not really. We're always fighting with each other. I'm the oldest, so I feel like I have to be the responsible one. But sometimes I just wish they would leave me alone.
